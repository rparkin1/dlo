Based on this [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49004-5_31).

## Installation
 Since `dlo` uses the [`LiTeFlow`](https://github.com/petrux/LiTeFlow) library, you must resolve the link dependency
during the instllation via the `--process-dependency-links` directive:

  $ pip install --process-dependency-links https://github.com/petrux/dlo.git
